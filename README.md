# Fraud-Detection

This repository demonstrates a binomial classification case of predictive analytics.

Context:
It is important that e-commerce companies are able to recognize fraudulent transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

Problem Statement: 
Identify if a particular transaction is fraudulent or not.

Solution:
Following packages are required for successful execution of code:
1 pandas
2 numpy
3 os
4 logging
5 warnings
6 scipy.stats
7 matplotlib
8 sklearn
9 collections
10 imblearn
11 graphviz
12 IPython

You can install every package using pip install

For example:
pip install pandas

Run the script:
To run the code, simply open the command prompt and go to the code folder in which the Fraud_detection.py file is saved.
Now execute the following command:
Python Fraud_detection.py

						OR
You can also use jupyter notebook which includes a detailed expanation of every step in the process.To run the jupyter notebook
open the command prompt. Go to the code folder and type 'jupyter notebook'. This will open a notebook in the browser. Now you can open
the Fraud_Detection.ipynb file in the browser and run it.

Note: 
The plots and decision tree graph will be saved as .png file in the code folder post execution of Fraud_detection.py script.
